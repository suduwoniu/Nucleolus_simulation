# Nucleolus_simulation
These codes are all for the simulation of sub-nucleolus simulation

Mento: Searching for the optimal distribution of processing factors in one sub-nucleolus unit using Mento Carlo strategy

SimulationClusterNumber: Simulation the cluster number in the max-cross section from different cluster number of one sub-nucleolus unit

ImageAlignment: Register two images to get an average image (This code is adapted from the https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18401-efficient-subpixel-image-registration-by-cross-correlation)

## Mento
inner3_calo_meto_v3.m: The main matlab code for simulation

moveSteps_max_v1.m: 

CalEffect_all_new_v4.m: Code for calculation of binding ability for each processing factor
