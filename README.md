# Nucleolus_simulation
These codes are all for the simulation of sub-nucleolus simulation
Mento: Searching for the optimal distribution of processing factors in one sub-nucleolus unit using Mento Carlo strategy
SimulationClusterNumber: Simulation the cluster number in the max-cross section from different cluster number of one sub-nucleolus unit
ImageAlignment: Register two images to get an average image (This code is adapted from the https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18401-efficient-subpixel-image-registration-by-cross-correlation)
